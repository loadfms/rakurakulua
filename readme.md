# Virtual Pet Project

This project is a simulation of the old Tamagotchi virtual pet toy, specifically the Rakuraku Dinokun version. It is a work in progress project that aims to recreate the fun and nostalgia of the classic virtual pet toy.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the virtual_pet.lua file in a Love2D environment. Once the game is running, you will see your virtual pet on the screen, along with its current stats, such as its hunger, happiness, and energy levels.

Your goal is to keep your virtual pet happy and healthy by taking care of its needs. You can feed it by clicking on the food icon, play with it by clicking on the ball icon, and let it rest by clicking on the bed icon. Be careful not to let any of its stats drop too low, or it may get sick or even die!

## Features

Currently, the game includes the following features:

- A UI with ractive buttons

## Future Plans
